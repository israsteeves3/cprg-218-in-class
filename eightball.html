    <form>
        <label for="question">What do you want to Know?</label> <!--for= explains that the label and input are connected 
        and therefore in your code they need to match-->
        <input type="text" id="question" style="width: 60ch;"> <!--changing inline bc it sfor one thing. ch is character count, allows in
        this case for 60 characters and eliminates scrolling issue. can use user research to see what size, bc sometimes if too small will
        encourage small answers and less feedback on forms-->
        	<!--<input type="text" id="question" placeholder="What do you want to ask the magic 8 ball?"> this will give 
            placeholder text in the box and when the box is typed in the text you added there disappears-->
        <input type="button" id="shake" value="Ask Now"> <!--can put an emojii here if you want, but with UX in mind, add text 
        with it if using an emojii. labelled as shake bc js doesnt like ask-->
